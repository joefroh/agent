Model Notes:
- gemma3 is small and quick, but cant use tools (at least not directly)
- deepseek-r1 has to be told to respond in english, but has some thinking construct
- llama3.1 can use tools
- qwen 3 with some system prompt hacking seems to work great. If you don't instruct it well from the sys prompt it essentially refuses to do anything you don't give it a tool for.
